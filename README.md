> getGetter() - a brief history of JavaScript [Symbol.iterator]. 

# Abstract
There was a time when we did load all data in a single JavaScript command.

But with time going by, data growing and our interpreters evolving we finally
managed to build something like an asynchronous cloud in JavaScript. With this
Cloud we can fetch our items one by one, instead of keeping everything in memory.

Sounds awesome, doesn't it? You're right.. its speed is.. ugh, what should I say?

# Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Getting started
Run the following commands one after another. Each command will introduce you
to a new problem and a possible solution to it. Read the output carefully and
take a look at the implementation if necessary. You should understand each single
step before carrying on to the next one.

```shell script
node step_1
node step_2
node step_3
node step_4
node step_5
```
